# ML-Algorithms-from-scratch
This repo contains codes for popular Machine Learning Algorithms written using Numpy. These tend to be very useful to understand each algorithm in detail as well as for interview purposes.


Below are the algorithms and key details:- 

1. Decision Tree
2. Linear & Logistic Regression 
3. Neural Networks
4. Kmeans Clustering

Apart from ML algorithms, it also contains numpy code for below:-

1. Evaluation and Validation 
2. Probability and Statistics
3. Practice ML coding Questions.
